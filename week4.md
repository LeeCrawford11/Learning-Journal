<h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>
This week I created a website using Docker WordPress as it's CMS. I followed along with the recommended Docker repo and found the information it contained quite useful when constructing the site.
I also completed Mapping the Modern Web Design Process series of videos.

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
2.5
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
I can see how the skills I gained this week are going to help me with the assignment. In particular local hosting.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
The process of setting up a WordPress site using Docker, as explored in the practical exercise, served as great experience towards understanding the intricacies of web development environments.
This hands-on experience was significantly enhanced by supplementing the practical knowledge with a LinkedIn Learning course. The course provided deeper insights not covered in my initial web design subject.
The approach of alternating between guided learning and working on the practical proved to be highly effective.
