<h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>
This week, I learned about Sass, a CSS preprocessor that allows for more dynamic and efficient styling of web pages.
I created a site to test Sass called "The Cheese Chronicles", aiming to incorporate variables, mixins, nesting, and inheritance efficiently.
My primary resources were the official Sass documentation, YouTube and the lecture videos.

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
3-4 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
Using Sass/SCSS to generate CSS code was an interesting topic. The fact that I could structure it in a way that was similar to programming languages helped me understand it a little better I believe.
I especially appreciated being able to declare variables and nesting. 
Also Sass’s ability to make more complex, maintainable and dynamic stylesheets seems like such a huge gamechanger compared to raw CSS, I’m surprised I hadn’t heard of it before.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
My learnings on Sass opened my eyes to the importance of efficient, maintainable code in web development, especially for larger projects or when working in a team.
Being proficient in tools like Sass can make a developer much more valuable, as it shows an understanding of the need for scalability and efficiency in codebase management.
If I ever want to pursue a career in Web Dev it’s clear that further development of skills linked to tools like Sass are a must have.
