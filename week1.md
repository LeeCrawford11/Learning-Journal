<h2>Learning Activities & Resources\</h2>
This week I created a static website for a fictional startup call MakerMesh.\
I tried out a few options for hosting but settled on GitHub pages for the hosting and PHP Storm with some usage of Bootstrap for the creation of the site.\
I used a few resources to help me accomplish this (Linked below).\
https://www.w3schools.com/ (for html, css and bootstrap)\
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20721248/how-can-i-override-bootstrap-css-styles\
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/\


<h2>Estimated Hours\</h2>
I spent around 5 hours in total trying out a few different options for hosting, making the site,\
deploying it with GitHub pages and general troubleshooting issues I had getting it all to work how I wanted it to.\

<h2>Content Insights\</h2>
Having never used bootstrap I found it quite handy to get the website up and running faster than I would have otherwise as I’m a little rusty with web dev.\
The examples I used plus my own css file made the process of setting up and customising the site much simpler.  \
Also, I’m somewhat familiar with GitHub but have never used it to host a website, though it took some tinkering to get it to work properly it was a valuable experience. \

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights\</h2>
The biggest take away for me was using GitHub pages for hosting, as I had no idea that was an option.\
It makes me curious as to what other features GitHub has that I might have missed, and I plan on looking into it further. \
Version control is such an important tool for any company developing software or websites that having a firm grasp on VC can only help my chances of finding employment after I have finished my degree.\
