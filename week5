<h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>
For this week’s practical we were required to make a child theme for WordPress. I chose to use my assignment website’s theme Sinatra.
I watched the WordPress: Building Child Themes series of videos to gain some insight into what the process of creating child themes entails.
I found it somewhat helpful for the initial setup an implementation but had troubles customising the child theme to override the parent theme.
I eventually overcame them, but it took a lot of searching online to do so. Also the lecture recording helped introduce me to using the inspector tool to help find the elements I wanted to customise.

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
The use and creation of child themes is a useful skill as it allows you to build upon existing themes without editing the original theme.
It also helps to avoid issues that might effect the look and customization of your site if the parent theme is updated in the future.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
Using child themes save a lot of work in customising the look of a site. 
It also saves time which is important in a business setting. 
It useful to be exposed to the concept and is definitely a tool ill use if I’m ever required to set up or maintain a website in the future.
