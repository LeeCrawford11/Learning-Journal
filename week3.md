<h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>
This week I created a website using WordPress as it's CMS. I used 000webhost.com to host it. I followed along with the recommended WordPress course and found the information it contained quite useful when constructing the site.

My biggest takeaway during this process is that all hosting sites are not created equal. My decision to choose 000webhost.com was mostly down to its free option having the features I needed to get the site up and running quickly.
I had a few weird issues, the site claiming I had tried to access the editor too many times then locking me out for an hour. Once I was aloud to use it again the pages I had created would no longer open citing a JSON error and would 404.
In the future Ill use a more reliable sitehost.
