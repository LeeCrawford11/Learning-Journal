<h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>
This week I worked on the advice shop website. I added a “proper” login system with a username and password system.
I also added some fun pages to the site. It took my awhile to get my head around PHP but overall I quite enjoyed this prac. 
I used the lecture videos, learning sites, YouTube and just general googling to complete the prac.

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
Around 4 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
This prac was a great learning process as I hadn’t really used PHP before.
The lecture videos along with the sample site the advice shop really helped me to understand the differences between HTML and PHP.
I’m most familiar with Python as a programming language, so getting used the to how PHP is semantically different with if statements and for/while loops took some getting used to.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
I didn’t fully grasp the exact point of PHP till this prac.
If I understand it correctly it seems to make a website a more dynamic experience as it can interact with databases or even generate HTML code among other things.
I assume I’m only scratching the surface of what PHP can do in a professional website.
