<h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>
This week my team and I set up our GitHub repo and Trello board for our group assignment. We also linked these services to our Slack channel. We then did the preliminary planning for the site we had to create. 


<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
Around 3 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
I was unaware of Slacks ability to interface with various other platforms, I can see how linking with those platforms can help a user keep up to date with any changes or additions made.
I also had limited experience with Trello and was surprised by the quantity of useful templates it had for many types of project. 

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
GitHub and Trello or similar services are often used in many IT related industries and Iâ€™m starting to understand why.
The ability to keep track of work done, both through commit histories and the various work management tools Trello has can be extremely powerful.
My hope is that through the course of this assignment I gain a deeper understanding of how to use these tools.
