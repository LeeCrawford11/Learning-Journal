<h2>Introduction:</h2>
I’m experimenting with a different learning style from what I usually use called the Pomodoro Technique.
This technique claims to improve focus and learning efficiency by breaking work into intervals, usually 25mins in length, separated by 5-10 minute breaks.

<h2>Hypothesis:</h2>
Using the Pomodoro Technique will increase my study efficiency and retention compared to my usual study method by reducing burnout and improving focus.

<h2>Method:</h2>
My test will involve learning the basics of 2 coding languages using google and youtube.
I will select the learning materials ahead of time.
I will allocate 2 hours to each language then I will attempt to complete as many practice coding challenges on the website codewars.com.
The languages I will learn are C# and JavaScript as I have around the same amount of familiarity with both, which is a very small amount.
To keep it simple and aligned with the relatively short time allocated to learn each language, the challenges ill attempt will be the easiest setting and focus on arrays.
I will learn C# with my usual learning process and I will learn JavaScript with the Pomodoro Technique.

<h2>Results:</h2>
I started with my usual learning method which was going through all the materials and then performing the required task.
I used this method for C# and was able to complete 4 coding challenges.
For JavaScript I used the Pomodoro Technique and was able to complete 6 challenges.

<h2>Analysis:</h2>
The Pomodoro Technique was definitely effective, but the exact impact is hard to quantify as there were many factors that could have influenced the outcome. 
1.	The challenges are submitted by users on the website, so the style and wording of challenges varies, even with challenges marked at the same difficulty.
2.	The challenges themselves are selected at random so I could have just got easier challenges for JavaScript or harder for C#.
3.	Initially doing the challenges for C# might have prepared me to some extent for the challenges I did for JavaScript.


<h2>Learning Insights:</h2>
The process of doing this prac has peeked my interest in trying different learning methods.
There was a definite improvement in the number of challenges I completed, although I can’t necessarily 100% credit that to the new learning style I tried it certainly didn’t have a negative effect.
